        <p>
            To make chicken tortilla soup you need to first saute
            the onions and garlic then add spices like chili powder
            and oregano. After that you will need to add tomatoes,
            broth, and water. You may then add corn, hominy, chiles,

            do after that is cook the soup for a few more minutes and
