        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            To make potato soup you will need to bake bacon and cook
            the celery, onion, and potatoes in the bacon's grease. 
            You will then need to add chicken stock to the celery,
            onion, and potatoes. Then you need to melt butter in
            another pan and add flour, heavy cream, tarragon, and
            cilantro before cooking. After you have cooked the mixture
            with flour and heavy cream you should add it to the original
            potato mixture. To finish you should blend half of the 
            mixture then add what you blended back to the original
            mixture and before you know it you have a bowl of potato 
            soup.
