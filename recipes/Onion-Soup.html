            Onion soup is a French dish that is made with caramelized onions and topped with
            bread and melted cheese. To make onion soup you will need to caramelize some onions 
            then add ingredients to the pan to create a broth. After that you may top your dish
            with bread and cheese and soon enough you will have a bowl of onion soup.
